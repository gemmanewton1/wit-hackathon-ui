# FastAPIProject Setup Guide

This guide explains how to install and run the FastAPIProject on your local machine.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or newer
- pip (Python package manager)

### How to Install Python and pip

1. **Download Python**
   - Go to the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
   - Download the latest version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

2. **Install Python**
   - Run the installer and follow the instructions.
   - On Windows, make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" during installation.

   - On macOS/Linux, Python is often pre-installed. If not, you can use package managers like Homebrew (macOS) or apt/yum (Linux) to install it.
     - For example, on macOS, you can run:
       ```zsh
       brew install python
       ```
     - if this is not installed you can install homebrew by running the following command in your terminal:
       ```zsh
       /bin/zsh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
       ```
     - This may be blocked, so do try to download python from the official website if you have issues.
     
3. **Verify Python and pip Installation**
   - Open a terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell on Windows).
   - Check Python version:
     ```zsh
     python --version
     ```
    - or on some systems you may need to use:
      ```zsh
      python3 --version
        ```
      
   - Check pip version:
     ```zsh
     pip --version
     ```
   - If both commands show a version number, Python and pip are installed correctly.

## Installation Steps

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**
   - Download the project files or clone the repository to your local machine.
   - This should have been done already if you followed the initial setup instructions.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   - Open a terminal and change to the project folder:
     ```
     cd path/to/python-starter
     ```
   - Replace `path/to/python-starter` with the actual path where you saved the project.
   - for example:
     ```
     cd C:\Users\YourName\Documents\python-starter
     ```
   - or on macOS/Linux:
     ```
     cd /Users/YourName/Documents/python-starter
     ```
   - This will be specific to where you have saved the project files.
   - If you want to find the location in the terminal you can use
   - Command on macOS/Linux
     ```zsh
     pwd 
     ```
   - Command on Windows.
      ```zsh
      cd 
      ```
   
3. **Set Up Virtual Environment**
    - We will be creating a python3 virtual environment to isolate our project dependencies.
    - In your terminal, run the following command to create a virtual environment named `venv
      ```zsh
      python3 -m venv venv
      ```
    - This will create a folder named `venv` in your project directory containing the virtual environment.
    - To activate the virtual environment, run:
    - On Windows:
      ```shell
      venv\Scripts\activate
      ```
    - On macOS/Linux:
      ```zsh
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```
    - You should see `(venv)` at the beginning of your terminal prompt, indicating that
    - the virtual environment is active.


4. **Install Dependencies**
   - Install required Python packages using pip:
     ```zsh
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

## Running the FastAPI Application
1. **Start the Server**
      - From here within the python project directory we will need to cd into source folder:
        ```zsh
        cd src
        ```
      - Run the following command in your terminal:
        ```zsh
        uvicorn fastapiproject.main:app --reload --port 8080
        ```
      - The server will start at `http://127.0.0.1:8080/`

2. **Access the API Documentation**
   - Open your browser and go to:
     - Swagger UI: [http://127.0.0.1:8080/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8080/docs)
     - ReDoc: [http://127.0.0.1:8080/redoc](http://127.0.0.1:8080/redoc)

## Running Tests

1. **Run the Tests**
   - In your terminal, execute:
     ```zsh
     pytest tests/test_customer_router.py
     ``` 
     ```zsh
     pytest tests/test_product_router.py
     ```
   - This will run all tests in the tests/test_main.py file and show the results.

## Manual API Testing with test_main.http

This project includes a test_main.http file for manual API testing. You can use this file with the [REST Client extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) or other compatible tools to send HTTP requests directly to your FastAPI server and view responses.

Example requests in test_main.http:
- `GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/` — Checks if the server is running.
- `GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/hello/User` — Example endpoint for greeting a user (if implemented).

To use:
1. Open test_main.http in VS Code.
2. Install the REST Client extension.
3. Click the 'Send Request' link above each request to test your API endpoints interactively.

This is useful for quickly verifying endpoint responses and debugging your API during development.

## MongoDB Integration
This project uses MongoDB as its database for storing and retrieving customer and product data. All CRUD operations for these resources are performed using MongoDB, providing persistent and scalable data storage.

### How MongoDB is Used
- The MongoDB connection is managed in `src/fastapiproject/db.py` using the async Motor driver.
- The connection URI is loaded from an environment variable (`MONGODB_URI`) or a `.env` file for security and flexibility.
- Each API router (for customers and products) interacts with MongoDB collections using async methods for high performance.
- Data is validated and serialized using Pydantic models before being stored or returned.

### Setting Up MongoDB
1. **Install and Start MongoDB**
   - Download and install MongoDB from [mongodb.com](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).
   - Start the MongoDB server locally or use a cloud-hosted MongoDB instance.

2. **Configure the Connection**
   - Create a `.env` file in your project root with:
     ```
     MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017
     ```
   - Update the URI if using a remote or cloud MongoDB.

3. **Install Motor and python-dotenv**
   - These are listed in `requirements.txt` and should be installed with:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

### How Data Flows
- When you create, update, or delete a customer or product, the API endpoints interact directly with MongoDB collections.
- All queries and updates are performed asynchronously for scalability.
- The database name defaults to `fastapi_db` but can be changed in the code or via environment variables.

### Benefits
- **Persistence:** Data is not lost when the server restarts.
- **Scalability:** MongoDB can handle large datasets and concurrent requests.
- **Security:** Connection details are managed via environment variables, not hardcoded.

## What is FastAPI?
FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. It is designed for building robust and scalable RESTful APIs quickly and easily, with automatic data validation, interactive documentation, and support for asynchronous programming. FastAPI is widely used in commercial and open-source projects for its speed, ease of use, and automatic generation of OpenAPI and JSON Schema documentation.

## Models Used in This Project

### Customer Model
Represents a customer with the following fields:
- `id` (Optional[str]): Unique identifier for the customer, generated by the server.
- `name` (str): The customer's name.
- `email` (str): The customer's email address.

### Product Model
Represents a product with the following fields:
- `id` (Optional[str]): Unique identifier for the product, generated by the server.
- `name` (str): The product's name.
- `description` (str): A description of the product.
- `price` (float): The price of the product.

Both models use Pydantic for data validation and serialization, ensuring that incoming and outgoing data matches the expected structure and types.
