## üóÑÔ∏è How to Start and Stop the Database (MongoDB with Docker)

1. Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed. [Docker & Rancher Desktop](./DOCKER_RANCHER_DESKTOP)  

2. **Start MongoDB:**
   - At the root of your project (where `docker-compose.yml` is), run:
     ```sh
     docker compose up -d
     ```
   - Or:
     ```sh
     docker-compose up -d
     ```
   - This starts MongoDB as a background service.

3. **Stop MongoDB:**
    ```sh
    docker compose down
    ```
   or
    ```sh
    docker-compose down
    ```
