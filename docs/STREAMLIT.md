## Setup Instructions (assuming you've installed python now)

## 1. Set Up a Python Virtual Environment

A virtual environment keeps your project’s Python libraries separated from those installed globally on your system.

### On **macOS** or **Linux**
Open your terminal and run:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### On **Windows**
Open Command Prompt and run:
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```
## 2. Install required dependencies
Make sure you're in the project directory (where `requirements.txt` is located), then run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## 3. Run the Streamlit App
Start the Streamlit app by running:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
