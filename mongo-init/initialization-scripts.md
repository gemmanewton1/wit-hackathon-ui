# MongoDB Initialization Scripts Guide

This guide explains how to use the MongoDB setup scripts (`.js` files) with your Docker-based development environment. These scripts help you automatically create collections, enforce schema validation, and seed initial data for your hackathon project. Setup.js is connected tp the database but dummySetup.js is just another example of the kind of data schema you could have.

## üöÄ What Are Setup Scripts?

- **Setup scripts** are JavaScript (`.js`) files placed in a folder (`mongo-init`, for example) that is mounted into your MongoDB container.
- On the first database initialization, MongoDB will execute all scripts in this directory, allowing you to:
    - Create collections
    - Configure schema validation
    - Insert sample data
- The setup.js, which is what the starter apps use, do not enforce any schema validation, but it is generally good practice in software development to do so. setupDummy.js has examples of this.

## üì¶ Where to Put Setup Scripts

- Place your scripts (e.g. `setup.js`) in a directory called `mongo-init` in the root of your project.
