## üöÄ Welcome to the WiT Hackathon Repository!

This repository contains multiple project starters you can explore and use freely.
For the hackathon, your project will need three key components:

### üß© Project Structure

- **Frontend** ‚Äì The user interface (UI). This is what users see and interact with.
- **Backend** ‚Äì Handles business logic and communicates with the database.
- **Database** ‚Äì Stores all your app‚Äôs data.


### üõ† Choosing Your Tech Stack
You‚Äôre free to choose any combination of technologies. However, due to time constraints, we recommend picking a stack in a language you're already comfortable with.

If you're **new to coding** , we suggest using **Next.js**:
- It‚Äôs all in **JavaScript**.
- Combines frontend and backend in one framework.
- Requires minimal setup, so you can focus on building.


### üéØ Project Starters

#### üñ•Ô∏è Frontend
- React - good for interactive user interfaces (javascript, needs node)
- Streamlit - good for data visualisation and quick prototypes (needs Python 3)
- Next.js app - Combines React frontend and backend API routes (javascript, needs node)

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Backend
- Java - Use for robust backend services (needs Java 17)
- Python, FastAPI - Lightweight and fast (needs Python 3)
- Next.js app - Includes backend API routes (javascript, needs node)

#### üóÑÔ∏è Database
- MongoDB - Flexible NoSQL database (Requires Docker or Rancher Desktop to run locally)

Note:  If you choose **Streamlit** for your frontend, you do **not** need to set up a database. However, this means you won‚Äôt be able to store data persistently.

## üìö Getting Started

| 2         | [Streamlit](./docs/STREAMLIT.md)                              |
| 3         | [Next.js*](./docs/NEXTJS.md)                                  |

* Next.js is also a backend project

#### Backend project starters (Choose 1)

| Section 2 | Description                                                   |

| 6         | [Next.js*](./docs/NEXTJS.md)                                  |

* Next.js is also a frontend project

#### Database (Install Docker/Rancher Desktop to run MongoDB)

| Section 3 | Description                                                   |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 7         | [Docker & Rancher Desktop](./docs/DOCKER_RANCHER_DESKTOP)     |
| 8         | [MongoDB ](./docs/MONGODB.md)                                 | 
| 9         | [MongoDB Dummy Data Setup*](./docs/MONGODB_DATA_SETUP.md)     | 

* Not essential, useful if you want to have data already loaded into your database 

Happy coding!
